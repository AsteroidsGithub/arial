# ðŸ’¾ arial.os - A x86 Hobby Operating System
A simple x86 hobby OS built in C. Designed to help myself feel more conformable with working in lower level software development, the end goal is to get into userspace and create a semi good looking widget kit.

## ðŸ—¿ Milestones
- [x] Setup toolchain for macOS
- [x] VBE Graphics rendering
- [ ] Switch existing Debug and Info functions to VBE over VGA
